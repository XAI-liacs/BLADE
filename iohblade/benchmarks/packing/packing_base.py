- Write a Python class with a __call__ method that generates and returns a NumPy array of shape (n, 3). Each row of the array represents one inner hexagon that is fitted inside a larger outer hexagon, with the following values:
    - x: the x-coordinate of the hexagon’s center.
    - y: the y-coordinate of the hexagon’s center.
    - theta: the rotation angle of the hexagon (in radians)
- The constranits on the hexagons are:
    - No two hexagons must overlap.
    - Hexagon must lie fully inside outer regular hexagon, with side s, and theta 0.
    - Each hexagons are assumed to be regular, with side 1.
- Objective is to minimise s; the side of outer hexagon.

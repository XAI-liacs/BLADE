- Write a Python class, with `__call__` method that CONSTRUCTS a finite integer set U.
- Constraints:
    - U is non negative integer.
    - 0 is in U
    - |U| <= max_size passed to the class constructor.
- Objective:
    - Maximize {formula}
        - where |U±U| are the cardinalities of the sum/difference sets and max(U) is the largest element of U.
        - The evaluator computes:
            c(U) = 1 + log(|U−U| / |U+U|) / log(2*max(U) + 1)
            - which lower-bounds C6 per Gyarmati–Hennecart–Ruzsa.
- Output contract:
    - The `__call__(self) -> iterable[int]` must yield U (list or set is fine).
-   Notes/tips for search:
    - Favor constructions with large |U−U| and small |U+U| while keeping max(U) modest.
    - Ensure 0 is included.
    - Keep integers non-negative.
    - Respect max_size.
    - Useful families to try:
        - greedy/Sidon-like sets,
        - Golomb-ruler style, block + gaps,
        - digital/bit-pattern constructions, unions of progressions, randomized hill-climbing.

# Erdös Minimum-Overlap Benchmark
* Minimise the max dot product of overlaping pointwise complement function f, and g (f + g = 1).

## Problem Statement
* The continuous Erdős minimum-overlap problem seeks to find measurable functions f,g: [-1,1] → [0,1] that satisfy:
  * **Complementarity**: f(x) + g(x) = 1 for all x ∈ [-1,1].
  * **Unit mass**: $\int_{-1}^1 f(x)dx = \int_{-1}^1 g(x)dx = 1$ .
  * **Bounds**: $f(x), g(x) \in [0,1] \forall x ∈ [-1,1]$ .
* The goal is to minimise the overlap integral of the two functions:
  $$
    C_5 \doteq \sup_{x\in [-2,2]}\int_{-1}^1f(t)g(x+t)dt
  $$
  * where $g$ is extended by zero outside $[-1, 1]$.

* **Target**: The AlphaEvolve result shows $C_5 \le 0.380924$ (previous best: $0.380927$).

This is the continuous limit of the discrete minimum-overlap problem originally posed by Erdős in 1955.

## How a Candidate is Evaluated.
* Each of the code string provided by LLaMEA solution is:
  1. **Sandboxed execution**: The candidate Python code is executed with `exec()` using a limited safe_globals whitelist, which is generated by searching for import statements and aliases, and generating associated `global_ns` dictionary for `exec()`.
  2. **Expected Return Value**: A callable class must return a `tuple(f_values, g_values)` where both are `numpy` arrays representing function values on a uniform grid over $[-1,1]$.
  3. **Validation**: The provided tuple is then validated using following checks:
      * Check that `f_values`, `g_values` $\in [0,1]$
      * Verify that $f + g = 1$ pointwise (within numerical tolerance)
      * Ensure that ∫f ≈ ∫g ≈ 1 using numerical integration.
  4. **Overlap Computation**: For multiple shift values x ∈ [-2,2], compute the overlap integral $\int_{-1}^1 f(t)g(x+t)dt$ using numerical integration with linear interpolation.
  5. **Fitness**: `Solution.set_scores(sup_x overlap(x), details)`.

## Known Results:
* The know optimal values $M(n)$ for small $n$ are:
  |n | M |
  |--|--|
  |1 | 1 |
  |2 | 1 |
  |3 | 2 |
  |4 | 2 |
  |5 | 3 |
  |6 | 3 |
  |7 | 3 |
  |8 | 4 |
  |9 | 4 |
  |10 |5 |
  |11 |5 |
  |12 |5 |
  |13 | 6 |
  |14 | 6 |
  |15 | 6 |

* For large n, it is known that:
  * Lower bound: $M(n) \le 0.379005n$ (White, 2022)
  * Upper bound: $M(n) \le 0.38093n$ (Haugland, 2016)
  * The limit $\lim_{n→∞} M(n)/n$ exists and is conjectured to be around $0.38$.

## Alpha Evolve's Continuous Approach
AlphaEvolve tackled the **continuous version** of Erdős's minimum-overlap problem, not the original discrete formulation:

| Aspect | What AlphaEvolve optimised | Continuous? |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Search space** | Functions f:[-1,1]→[0,1] with ∫f=1 (and g=1-f). In practice they restricted to step functions with ~200 sub-intervals. Heights on each interval are real numbers in [0,1]. | Yes - Continuous vector of real variables (one height per interval) |
| **Constraint** | ∫_{-1}^{1} f = 1. With steps this is an affine linear constraint on the heights. | Yes - Linear equality in ℝ^m |
| **Objective** | Minimise max_{x∈[-2,2]} I(x) where I(x)=∫_{-1}^{1} f(t)(1-f)(x+t)dt. For step functions this boils down to a piece-wise smooth function of the heights. | Yes - A (nonsmooth) continuous function |
| **Algorithm** | Evolutionary / gradient-free search and local polishing. | Yes - Works on continuous parameters |

* So while the original problem is combinatorial, AlphaEvolve's instance is a finite-dimensional continuous optimisation task:
  * Variables: real step heights h₁, ..., h_m
  * Constraint: single linear condition Σ h_i × (interval length) = 1
  * Objective: minimise a Lipschitz but nonsmooth max-integral function of those heights

*The search is still challenging because m can be hundreds and the objective is non-convex and nonsmooth, but it is continuous.*

Write a python class with function `__call__`, that returns a list of floats f of length N.

- Auto-convolution of `g = dx * conv(f, f, mode=""full"")`, where g lies in range [-1/2, 1/2].
- Optimise for objective of minimize  max_t (f*f)(t) / (∫ f)^2, where all entries in the list f must be greater than or equal to 0 and do not normalise the f, scaling does not change the score.
- Symmetry or piecewise-constant structure is allowed if helpful.
